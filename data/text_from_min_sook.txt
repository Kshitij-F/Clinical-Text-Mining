"It has been my constant companion for 13 years.

It has been my own personal hell.

But somedays I love having it.

 
We have inside jokes that no one but diabetics would possibly find funny. And they are hilarious. We are sarcastic and sassy and we all struggle. And it is calming to know that I am not the only one who has a high A1c or forgets to poke.

 
I read a blog where the person asked if diabetes was cured, what is the first thing you would do? Most people said take a trip or exercise or eat a crazy amount of food. But not me. I honestly dont know what I would do. Maybe cry? Feel relief at never having another disorientating low or never having to pay boatloads for supplies every couple of weeks? 

 
I would also feel longing. Longing to have it back because it has defined me for so long. It has always been the one thing I have that is unique. The one thing that has made me who I am. I would miss the way all diabetics are connected to each other, even if they dont know it. We are a giant family of people who have to try harder and be better at doing something as basic as living.

 
During the frequent times that I feel completely alone and alienated because no one can possibly understand what I am going through or how bloody hard it is, it is nice to remember that there are so many others like me. I take comfort in that and suddenly it doesnt seem like such a horrible thing.
